              Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public
              spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2" >
              Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, their request will be complied with. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
            </li>
            <li class="py-2" >
              Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2" >
              As this is a confernece, we like to explicitly note that the discussions discussed at our confernece are equally subject to the anti-harassment
              policy.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2" >
              Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2" >
              If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of Conference volunteers immediately.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2" >
              WiT volunteers will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide volunteers, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value
              your attendance.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2" >
              If a participant engages in harassing behavior, WIT organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the WIT Conference with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2" >
              We expect participants to follow these rules at talks and workshop venues and WiT-related social events.
